Introduction
============

You may ask why another static site generator, when there are so many others? Valid question, simple answer: all the others are doing it wrong. No, seriously, tools like `Jekyll <https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll>`_, `Hyde <http://hyde.github.io/>`_ or `mynt <http://mynt.uhnomoli.com/>`_ are very powerful and probably provide more features out of the box than Logya ever will.

Two key differences comparing Logya with the above tools are:

* Content can be written in markdown **and** HTML.
* More flexible site URL structure: By default URLs will be determined from the documents location within the content directory, but they can also be set manually to arbitrary values, which is useful when migrating WordPress or Drupal sites for example.
