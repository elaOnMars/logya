<p>Logya is a command line tool to generate static Web sites, designed to be easy to use and flexible.</p>
<p>Content documents contain header information like url, title, scripts and style sheets to use and a body marked up with HTML, they are stored in .html files.</p>
<p>A site's layout and design are fully controlled by the user, templates are rendered with jinja2.</p>
<p>Logya provides a serve command to immediately view changes in the browser when source documents and static files were changed.</p>
<p>Everything needed for a site is stored in the file system and thus can be controlled using source code management systems like git, mercurial or subversion.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Logya is an open source Python application that can be <a href="https://github.com/yaph/logya/downloads">downloaded from</a> and <a href="https://github.com/yaph/logya">forked on Github</a>. To install it with pip run:</p>
<pre>sudo pip install logya</pre>

<p>If you downloaded the source files, you can install Logya from the project's root directory with the following command:</p>
<pre>sudo python setup.py install</pre>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<h3>Create a starter site:</h3>
<pre>logya create mysite</pre>
<p>This command will create a new sub directory in your current working directory called mysite, that includes the resources for a logya starter site.</p>

<h3>Change to the starter site directory:</h3>
<pre>cd mysite</pre>

<h3>Generate files to deploy:</h3>
<pre>logya generate</pre>
<p>This command generates HTML files from the documents found in the content directory, indexes for Web site directories, and copies static resources to the newly created deploy directory.</p>

<h3>Serve site from deploy directory:</h3>
<pre>logya serve</pre>
<p>Run this command in the root directory of your mysite project and it will serve the static files from the deploy directory. When you edit files in your projects source directory and reload them in the browser they will be updated, so this can be used for live editing your site and see changes immediately.</p>

<h3>Get help on logya command:</h3>
<pre>logya -h</pre>
<p>Show the help output of the logya command with information on sub commands and options, for help on a sub command call it with the -h option, e.g. <code>logya create -h</code>.</p>

<h2>Document Structure</h2>
<p>Documents are basically html files containing the content of a page with header information to specify title, url, description, scripts and style sheets to include and self defined variables that can be accessed in templates.</p>
<p>The header of this file looks like:</p>
<pre>
url: /
title: Logya Documentation
template: post.html
</pre>
<p>The content is what you read right now ;)</p>

<h2>Configuration Settings</h2>
<p>Below you find configuration sections and settings:</p>

<h3>[site] section</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>base_path</dt>
    <dd>If set will be available in all templates as base_path variable.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>[templates] section</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>index</dt>
    <dd>The template to use for generated index.html files. If not set, indexes won't be created.</dd>
  <dt>doc</dt>
    <dd>The template to use for generated content documents. If not set, the document won't be created.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>[extensions] section</h3>
<p>Currently this section is not supported. I consider using it for turning extensions on and off.</p>
<h2>Development Tips</h2>
<p>The following tips are intended for people developing logya application code.</p>
<h3>Create a command that points to the development source:</h3>
<pre>ln -s $HOME/code/logya/logya/main.py $HOME/bin/logyadev</pre>
<p>This creates a symbolic link in your home bin directory to access logya commands from your development source, assuming it resides in the first directory specified above. To not override the logya command from your installation the command is called logyadev.</p>
